   * Commercial

   Developer-based Commercial License Terms

   Each developer which uses the Wt API requires a Commercial License during
   the entire development and maintenance period of the web application. The
   Developer-based Commercial Licenses are valid for the duration of one year,
   and for any released version of Wt.

   There are no additional charges for distribution of the application, and the
   license allows the developer to work on an unlimited number of products.

   The license may not be passed on between developers, unless permission is
   granted by Emweb.

   Commercial licensed developers have access to the public community-driven
   mailing list for their support questions. A commercial license does not
   include guaranteed responses from Emweb's Wt developers, nor training. For
   support contracts, please consult our support offerings.

   Project-based Commercial License Terms

   As an alternative to the Developer-based Commercial License, a License may
   be purchased on a per-project basis. This License allows the usage of Wt by
   as many developers as necessary to complete a single pre-defined project.

   There are usually no additional charges for distribution of the application.

   Support options are usually negotiated together with the license. This
   guarantees, if required, personalized high-priority support in addition to
   the public, community-driven mailing lists.

Wt also includes in its tarball several other licenses for third party
components:
